                                              <div class="card-body article"> As per legends, an idol was found in the area (now known as Golconda Fort) by a shepherd. Soon after, Kakatiyan king was informed about the same, and he gave the order to build a mud fort around the idol. The fort came to be known as "Golla Konda"&nbsp;which meant Shepherd's Hill in Telugu. <br><br>The Golconda fort was erected in the year 1143 under the Kakatiya Dynasty. However, it rose to prominence when it came under the rule of Qutub Shahi Dynasty during the 16th century, i.e. when Quli Qutub Shah declared his independence from the Bahmani Sultanate in 1518. The striking fort since then expanded from a mud fortress to a lofty structure to having a 10 km outer wall. After a failed attempt in the year 1686, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb was finally able to breach the impregnable fort in 1687 after a long nine-month siege. </div>

                                              <div class="card-body article"> Golconda Fort is a grand structure built on a hill of altitude 400 feet with a circumference of 7 km displaying the beautiful fusion of Hindu-Islamic style of architecture. Its wall comprises of 8 gates and 87 bastions each one reaching the height of 50-60 feet. There are three powerful consecutive fortification walls each within the other. The first line of the wall contains town, the second line is a double wall that runs around the foot of the hill on which the citadel stands. The third line is further up the hill lying within the second comprised of masonry and natural boulders. Situated with the fortress are the dwellings of the queens and princesses and homesteads of their retainers. <br><br>The dazzling fort is quite famous for its royal apartments, parade grounds, numerous halls and mosques. Amongst the eight gates, Fateh Darwaza is the main gate as the victorious march of King Aurangzeb proceeded through it. This door is 13ft wide and 25ft long and was made up of steel spikes to protect it from elephants. The Balahisar Darwaza which was built using the Nawabi style and culture is another magnificent structure. Today, only the eastern gate can be visited by the tourists. The Golconda fort is situated on a hilltop and has superb airing which is what made life simpler for the royals during summers. </div>
