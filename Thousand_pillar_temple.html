                                <div class="readMoreText">
     
                                    <p> The Thousand Pillar Temple is an ancient temple that is tucked away in a small town named Hanamakonda in the vibrant state of Telangana. As the name suggests, the temple has over one thousand pillars, some of which are a part or extension of adjacent pillars! These pillars are so tightly knit, they practically form the walls of the temple. Constructed in a star-shaped architecture, the Thousand Pillars Temple is a popular pilgrimage centre which welcomes more than 1000 devotees almost every day. The temple also contains a huge monolith Nandi, made up of black basalt stone. The three shrines located in the temple are together known as Trikootalayam. <br></p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p> The mighty temple is a true specimen of Kakatiya architecture and Chalukyan architecture both, and this does a great job of enhancing its already overwhelming beauty.&nbsp; There are three presiding deities in this temple- Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Surya. According to the Hindu traditions, Lord Vishnu is the preserver of the universe- the one who ensures that elements of vitality are preserved to strike the balance, Lord Shiva is the destroyer of the universe- the one who destroys negative elements of the universe and give way to the birth of a new beginning, and Lord Surya- the sun god, the one who sustains the whole universe by his warmth; without whom the whole universe would be just an enormous pit of darkness. And to think that this temple houses the shrines of all the three mighty lords under one roof, a compelling reason to witness this powerhouse of positive vibes and uplifting energy. The temple was built by Rudra Deva and hence houses a deity in his name too. </p>

                                              <h3> History of Thousand Pillars Temple </h3>
                                            </div>
                                            <div id="collapse2" class="accordion-item collapse show" style="">
                                              <div class="card-body article"> The masses of the Kakatiya dynasty were followers of Shivaism, devotees of Lord Shiva. The intellectuals, however, chose to believe in the revival of Vedic rituals and sought to reconcile the Vaishnavites, worshippers of Lord Vishnu and Shaivites, worshippers of Lord Shiva through the worship of Harihara, worship of both. This initiative marked the birth of this phenomenal temple. </div>

                                              <h3> Architecture of Thousand Pillar Temple </h3>
                                            </div>
                                            <div id="collapse3" class="collapse accordion-item ">
                                              <div class="card-body article"> Built on the slopes of the Hanamaonda hill, this temple has a unique star-shaped base which stands to be an indicator of the exquisiteness of the Kakatiya architecture sprinkled with the royalty of Chalukyan design. The Kakatiya sculptor, who decorated and carved the complexes of the temple has definitely done justice to the name of the dynasty; showing distinctly unique styles and use of creative technology. Even though the count of the pillars reaches a three-digit number, each pillar looks like it has been worked on for decades! No matter the position or dimensions of the pillars, the perfect symmetry and design is such that no pillar obstructs the devotee's line of sight when they look towards the Lord. The intricate carvings and design on each pillar is a result of a supernaturally steady hand and unprecedented artistic skills.&nbsp;<br><br>The main shrines have sculptures of rock-cut elephants guarding them on each side, and there are beautiful carvings of the elephants on many pillars too. A six feet tall Nandi, made from a single huge black basalt rock, who is the holy 'vaahan'&nbsp;or vehicle of Lord Shiva, greets you at the entrance of the temple. The main shrine of the temple itself is held by 400 pillars of the total 1000.<br><br>Another noteworthy detail of&nbsp;Thousand Pillar Temple's architecture is its sandbox base. It is built using the sandboxing technique, where a huge pit is dug up and filled with heaps of sand and covered with huge rock beams. Then on this strong platform, the base of the structure is made by erecting tall beams and columns. This Kakatiya invention provides an unshakeable base for the structure and makes it immortal. </div>
