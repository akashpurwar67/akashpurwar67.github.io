                                    <p> A prominent landmark of the Telangana state and an apt example of architectural excellence and historical richness of the yore, the Warangal fort is situated in Warangal. The city is also known as Oru Kallu, which means 'a single stone'. Locals believe the city was built on a single rock in the medieval era. Sprawlingly spread across a stretch of 19 km between Warangal &amp; Hanamkonda, this 12th-century fort is a prominent historical attraction in Telangana. Every year thousands of enthusiastic tourists flock in to witness the historical and architectural marvel of this region.&nbsp;<br></p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p> The major highlights of Warangal&nbsp;fort are the four ornamental gates, which are now the official emblem of the Telangana state. The fort is in ruins today, still refelecting the historical grandeur and architectural preeminence of the Kakatiya Dynasty. The ruins hardly resemble any fort as the typical grand walls, cannons, the Darbaar Halls of the rulers are missing.&nbsp;However, what you can witness is the remnants of one of the most invincible fortifications of the medieval era.&nbsp;<br> </p>

                                              <h3> History of Warangal Fort </h3>

                                            <div id="collapse1" class="accordion-item collapse" style="">
                                              <div class="card-body article"> Named after the city Warangal, this eponymous fort gives us a clear understanding of the bygone Kakatiya Dynasty, which flourished between 1175 - 1324 CE. It was during this era that the Deccan Plateau witnessed a notable trend in establishing architectural marvels like Warangal Fort, reservoirs for irrigation and numerous temples. The rulers had not only emphasised on the safety of their territory, but every piece of their architecture was a masterpiece and became immortal. <br><br>This fabulous fort was built by Ganapatideva, and after he died in 1262, his daughter Rudrama Devi took over the charge of the construction and the entire kingdom eventually. However, King Prataparudra II, who was also known as Rudradeva II and the last ruler of Kakatiya Kingdom, finished the Warangal Fort. Unfortunately, 2 decades later the kingdom fell into the Mughal's hands and it was conquered by the Sultans of Delhi. <br><br>The Warangal fort was attacked numerous times. In 1309, Alauddin Khilji had launched an attack on the fort during the rule of Prataparudra II. Around 1000,000 soldiers had attacked the fort, and the battle lasted for many months. King Prataparudra II and his army were able to defend the fort in this fierce battle. However, the fort couldn't resist the attack of Qutub Shahi Dynasty, and later it was invaded by the Hyderabad Nizams. Although&nbsp;it was destroyed numerous times, what we see today are not simply the ruins but the grandiosity of the medieval architecture foretelling the bravery of the Kakatiya rulers. </div>

                                              <h3> Architecture of Warangal Fort </h3>
                                            </div>
                                            <div id="collapse2" class="collapse accordion-item ">
                                              <div class="card-body article"> The Warangal Fort was a piece of its kind, flaunting the architectural excellence of the 12th century. The fort was built on Thorean architectural style. Before it was turned into debris, the fort flaunted 45 grand pillars flanked by intricate carvings. The 'Gateway of Glory' was the major highlight. This was the main gateway built of four elaborately carved pillars constructed out of a single rock. Those pillars were around 30 feet in height, and sculptures on the pillars are even worth noticing today even though they are in ruins. These majestic gateways were also known as Kirti Toranas and stood as a symbol of South Indian architectural style.<br><br>Just as you walk into the fort, you can see some remnants of a temple, Swayambhudevi Alayam (Temple of Mother Earth). After conquering the Warangal Fort, the Qutub Shahi Kings had built this temple. However, the major attraction of this glorious fort is Swayambhu Devalayam, a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva built in 1162 AD. This medieval temple is located right in the middle of the fort and is flanked by awe-inspiring sculptures. The fort also houses another Shiva temple, Shambhulingeshwara Temple, located opposite to the Open air museum. A huge Nandi statute faces the Shiva Temple. <br><br>The space between the Nandi Statue and the temple was used as a platform for artists, where Nrityanganas (classical dancers) used to dance to the tunes of the musicians before the prayers begun. Most of the sculptures carved on the pillars of this fort follow a similar pattern, i.e. each stone is divided into different sections, and each section flaunts beautiful sculptures such as a lion, elephant, statues of dancers etc.<br><br>Warangal fort is built of 3-layered fortification. The fort was protected by three circular walls, offering robust defence against the invaders. The first wall of Warangal fort was built during the rule of Rudrama Devi. The diameter of this earthen wall is around 2.4 km. Another layer of 150 feet broad wall covers the outer part of the wall. </div>
