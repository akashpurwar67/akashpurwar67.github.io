                                <div class="readMoreText">
     
                                    <p> Once the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, the Chowmahalla Palace was built in Hyderabad between the years 1857 and 1869. In essence, Chowmahalla can be literally translated to mean 'Four Palaces'. The magnificent monument consists of two massive courtyards as well as a grand dining hall known as 'Khilawat'. This splendid monument that once served as the&nbsp;official residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad during their reign still retains some of its past splendour. It is still the property of Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah, heir of the Nizams and has been decorated with UNESCO's Asia Pacific Merit award in 2010 as well.</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p> The architecture of the Chowmahalla Palace is an imposing sight to behold. The facade itself is a delicate artwork of domes, arches, windows and meticulously carved out designs. The complex is elegantly embellished with gentle fountains, expansive lush gardens, numerous palaces, Clock Tower, Roshan Bangla and the Council Hall. The Courtyard here is a fairytale venue to hold the most exquisite dinner parties, with the palace standing firmly in the background. </p>

                                              <div class="card-body article"> The construction of the Chowmahalla palace was initiated by Salabat Jung in 1750 and it was completed during the period of Afzal ad Dawlah, Asaf Jah V. The fifth Nizam ensured the completion of the Chowmahalla palace within 1869. The Palace went on to become the main residence of the Nawabs and the royal court was held here as well. Even in the olden times, the palace was the main centre for all activities pertaining to the Nizam rule, including festive ceremonies and welcome parties hosted for esteemed guests. This was also a stopover for Grand Khilwat and served as a guesthouse for other royalty. It is believed to have taken inspiration from the Shah of Iran's palace in Tehran built by Juveria Khan Rahimullah. </div>

It has the raised marble platform where the Takht-e-Nishan or the royal seat was laid. This was where the major proceedings of the Nizam Court took place. Presently, it has a number of splendid Belgian chandeliers installed in its chambers. A Clock Tower which is also called the&nbsp;Khilwat Clock is also present here and has been ticking away for around 251 years. Its upkeep is maintained by an expert family of clock mechanics, who regularly examine the cogs&nbsp;and gears to keep the clock up and running. The Council Hall has an impressive collection of&nbsp;manuscripts and priceless books and served as the destination where the Nizams met important dignitaries and visitors. Presently, it holds a priceless collection of relics from the Chowmahalla Palace Collection. The Roshan Bangla in the premises of the Chowmahalla Palace is a royal chamber named after&nbsp;Roshan Begum.<br><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bara Imam:</strong>&nbsp;The Bara Imam is a long corridor of rooms which overlook the fountain and pool that were the administrative wing and&nbsp;Shishe-Alat in the olden times. This structure has a considerable Persian influence in its architecture, with&nbsp;domes and arches making multiple appearances. This part is situated in the Northern Courtyard&nbsp;of the CHowmahalla Palace and overlooks a building built in its exact image. It used to serve as a guest house for guests visiting the palace. <br><br>The Southern Courtyard of the Chowmahalla Palace has a number of other structures which add an ornate beauty to it. These include&nbsp;<strong>Afzal Mahal</strong>&nbsp;which is a two - storey building adorned with&nbsp;long&nbsp;pillars, detailed carvings, and majestic garden spaces,&nbsp;<strong>Mahtab Mahal</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Tahniyat Mahal</strong>&nbsp;which have delicate carvings and majestic archways adorning their white stone&nbsp;surface and <strong>Aftab Mahal,</strong>&nbsp;all of which<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are built in neo - classical architectural style. </div>
